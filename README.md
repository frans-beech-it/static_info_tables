## !! Attention !!
This is an **automatically** generated git version, based on the release into the [TYPO3 Extension Repository](http://www.typo3.org/extensions/).
You can find the original version at http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/static_info_tables/ .

It does not make sense to make pull requests as this repository has been created automatically from 3rd party, not from the original author(s).

Every version of the extension is tagged with the version number, therefore you can switch quite easily between different versions.
